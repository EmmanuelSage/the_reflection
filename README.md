# The Reflection

This repo contains links to code I wrote almost three years ago, using c# and the .net stack.

I recently repaired the PC I used and found these projects I did, I decided to glance over the code,
and WOW, I was stunned, Don't get me wrong, the code works but reading the code, there are a
lot of duplicated code, redundant logic, the most awful variable declarations and method naming, anti-patterns
and a ton more, I really just wanted to cry.

But then I realized this could mean I have grown and I shouldn't feel too bad, Hence the creation of this repository.

The goal is to push the projects to github, Linking to them here, while trying to spend sometime refactoring them
and recording what I refactored and why.

The projects are kinda okay project Ideas, and you're welcome to spot problems, there are a ton.
